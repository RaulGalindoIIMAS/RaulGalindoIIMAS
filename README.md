Hi!

I am a third-year PhD student at UNAM - IIMAS in the Artificial Intelligence group. My main research focuses on designing evolutionary and machine learning algorithms applied to biological datasets. I like to focus on how these computational approaches work, evolve, and identify potential solutions in a variety of problems.

I am very interested in looking at the patterns and relationships that the gene expression data have, exploring the different ways of processing biological data and analyzing how it changes the behavior of the evolutionary approach and its result.

I did my undergraduate at TecNM, where I got BAs in Computer Science. I did my master's degree at UNAM - IIMAS where my thesis was based on improving the accuracy of the prediction result utilizing neural networks in several mixed datasets.

I am funded by a CONACyT fellowship.

Everybody is welcome to collaborate in artificial intelligence related areas and can reach me at: raul.galindo.hernandez at comunidad.unam.mx
